* scripts/python/tacklebar/libs/npplib.py:

  Improve `-append` functionality and allow to append to any instance including
  the multi instance has used the `-nosession -multiInst` command line by add
  `-append -allow-multi-instance` flags.
  This would use the last created instance instead of a not multi (shared)
  instance.

  Reimplement `-append` without `-allow-multi-instance` flag to append to a
  last created not multi instance instead of to a first found.

* Improve `-append` functionality and not allow to append to a different
  user instance. Search by default only the same user instances.
